I really like how the Solitaire game came together. I used a Flyweight pattern by loading all 52 card images once into a cards[suit][value] table—so drawing a card is just a quick table lookup instead of reloading files every time. My DeckClass:new() loops through each suit and value, calls CardClass:new() to give every card its starting x, y, faceUp, and isHovered settings, and adds it to the deck. That same CardClass:new() works like a Prototype, too, since it sets up each new card with the same base behavior but lets each instance keep its own position and flip state. I put the dealing, playing, and winning steps into a simple State pattern so the game runs the right code at each stage and cards know whether they should show their back or face. For the main game flow I leaned on LÖVE’s love.load, love.update, and love.draw calls a Sequencing pattern, and I wrote an updateCardPositions() function as an Update Method so all cards slide into their correct spots after any move. Inside the card code I use a Type Object pattern with RANK_VALUES, RED_SUITS, and BLACK_SUITS tables; that way I can check a card’s color or value by looking at those tables instead of hard-coding rules. I kept everything tidy by splitting it into card.lua, pile.lua, deck.lua, and grabber.lua files (a Component setup), so each file just handles one job. GrabberClass watches the mouse, and love.mousepressed/love.mousereleased take care of picking up and dropping cards, doubling-click auto-moves, flips, scoring, and checking for a win. 



I focused on getting the rules and animations right. If I did this again, I’d add an undo/redo system using a Command pattern right from the start instead of tacking it on later, swap those simple face-up/face-down/hover flags for a small state machine so card states stay neat, and once the core felt solid I’d add sound effects, a little shuffle animation, and some background music to make the game feel more alive.
 
 For art I used Kenney’s Playing Cards Pack (https://kenney.nl/assets/playing-cards-pack) and stuck with the built-in 14 pt font—no sounds or extra effects
